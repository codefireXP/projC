Github is telling me to write a README at 11 in the night. Like I am do it. HAHAHAHAH.

Aight, fine.

Its a Suduku...Suokok...Soduko.. always with the spelling. What the hell? Let me searx search the spelling of Sukudo. You thought I was gonna do a Google search, ain't it? No, I do searx search. Too bad you don't have your own private instance. 

So, yeah this is a Suduko solver(yeah the 9x9 one) and it's written in C. I used NSIS installer to you know, make the installer executable of the program for the teacher I submitted this to. 

End of the story, let me sleep!!!!!!
